Description: Efficient computation of tradable and Oracle tradable factor 
    risk premia and their standard errors. Tradable factor risk premia are 
    defined by the negative factor covariance with the Stochastic Discount 
    Factor projection on returns. They are robust to misspecification or weak 
    identification in asset pricing models, and they are zero for any factor 
    weakly correlated with returns. We propose a simple estimator of tradable 
    factor risk premia that enjoys the Oracle Properties, i.e., it performs as 
    well as if the weak or useless factors were known. This means it not only 
    consistently removes useless factors and factors weakly correlated with 
    returns but also gives rise to reliable tests of asset pricing models.
